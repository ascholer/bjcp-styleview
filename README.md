# BJCP 2021 Style Viewer

This is a webapp designed for study and quick reference of the 2021 [Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) style guidelines](https://www.bjcp.org/bjcp-style-guidelines/).

If you ended up here while looking for the app, please go to https://ascholer.github.io/bjcp-styleview/

Style data is contained in [styles.json](styles.json). It is the result of running the PDF guidelines through a PDF --> markdown converter and then parsing that into json. There are likely some small issues due to that translation process.
